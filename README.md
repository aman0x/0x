Floorplan to 3D Model Converter
This project aims to convert a 2D floorplan image into a 3D model, load the 3D model, and render it using Blender. The tool leverages AI/ML algorithms to automatically detect and classify various elements in the floorplan, such as walls, windows, doors, and furniture, and then generates a 3D representation of the space.

Features
Image to 3D Conversion: Automatically detect and extract elements like walls, doors, windows, and furniture from a 2D floorplan image.
3D Model Generation: Create a 3D model from the detected elements.
Blender Integration: Load the generated 3D model into Blender for further modifications and rendering.
Rendering: Generate realistic renders of the 3D model using Blender's rendering engine.
Technologies Used
Python: For image processing, AI/ML model training, and data handling.
OpenCV: For image preprocessing and element detection.
Blender: For loading, modifying, and rendering the 3D models.
Django/Flask: Backend framework for handling file uploads and processing requests.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: AI/ML frameworks for training the model to detect elements from the floorplan image.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Blender 3.0 or higher: Install Blender and ensure it is available in your system's PATH.
OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
TensorFlow/PyTorch: Depending on your choice, install either TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Django/Flask: Backend framework of your choice for handling requests and file uploads.
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/floorplan-to-3d.git
cd floorplan-to-3d
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up the Backend

Configure your Django/Flask backend to handle file uploads and processing.
Ensure your backend can communicate with Blender for loading and rendering 3D models.
Configure Blender

Make sure Blender is correctly installed and accessible from the command line.
Add any necessary scripts to automate the loading and rendering process.
Usage
Upload a Floorplan Image

Use the provided frontend or API to upload a floorplan image.
Process the Image

The backend will process the image using AI/ML models to detect elements like walls, doors, windows, and furniture.
Generate a 3D Model

The detected elements are used to create a 3D model, which is then loaded into Blender.
Render the Model

Use Blender's rendering engine to generate high-quality images or videos of the 3D model.
Example
Run the backend server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver  # For Django
or

bash
Copy code
flask run  # For Flask
Access the frontend or use an API client to upload the floorplan image.

Follow the instructions to process the image, generate the 3D model, and render it.
